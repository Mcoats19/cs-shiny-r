 From? Invest. Academy specifically. A. LISN skills, R=28, Python=34, Both=11. Growth in past and with Academy in particular as moving away from SAS. 
 Note that under threat somewhat from databricks. We had a call with James Blair on 2/15 to mitigate that and for 1 of the 2 teams (health econ) it was well received). Need to build communication wtih the other team though (DS team). 
 Have an Academy cohort starting in Feb '24, need that to be a big success, then expand with a SAS to R initiative. 
 2 teams: 1) Dr. Novotny, Aaron, leads team with Thuy who manages Joe, Health Econ. 2) Dr. Justin Parker, DS team, leads Mario, more skeptical of us it seems and closer to databricks.

 As part of ANZ Bank?s company values, they challenge their team to be better by finding ways to work differently and using data to improve. In 2024, ANZ Bank?s people and systems stopped more than $140 million being sent to criminals One aspect that contributes to this work includes improvements to their fraud detection. To improve decision-making, they needed to build better models faster and more efficiently. Using Posit Team, ANZ Bank transformed their model validation process to replace manual steps with an automated workflow. With regulatory guidelines and audit requirements, it?s important for ANZ Bank to have a consistent and standardized approach for monitoring and validating models. Posit Team has helped ensure consistent metrics across multiple models and methodologies to ensure compliance. Rajashree Patra is the Product Owner for Posit Team at ANZ. In his role, he oversees the development and strategic direction of the Posit platform. His goal is to drive innovation and continuous improvement within the platform by collaborating closely with cross-functional teams. ?We?ve reduced the once cumbersome 15-step process to just 3 efficient steps, allowing our team to focus on what really matters?building better models faster and more effectively. By automating the repetitive tasks involved in monitoring and validation, Posit has saved [ANZ Bank] more than 60,000 hours annually.? 
 Which version of each product is the customer currently running on? The last time I spoke to them, they were on 2024 versions.

 AXA XL is in the midst of a major migration from on prem to Azure. AXA XL has worked with a consulting firm the last year or so and one of the ideas that was floated that the org should diversify and not rely so much on R (Shiny). They have hundreds of Shiny applications that are used widely across the org, especially in their RDAPP (Risk Decision and Pricing Platform). They have several hundred actuaries who love and use R (PWB) and moving to Python would be a huge shift. However, Steve needs to understand that we are investing heavily in Python. We have also discussed Python training with Academy over the years as well.Also we just learned that they want to review the potential to move RDAPP models out of Posit Connect and to deploy them instead in Salesforce. That way AXA XL employees can then create proposals and quotes directly in Salesforce for customers. They have 4K PCT users currently so that is definitely a risk. Our understanding is that no final decisions have been made.Additionally AXA XL is moving a lot of work to Databricks (they are not using Snowflake at all).

9/3/25 ES: Gerhard to confirm number of R users and plan for any potential services needs in 2026. Might also be scheduling a User Training exploration session with Ryan Johnson. 

8/20/25 ES: Monthly check-in - Python team is up and running and PCT issue has been resolved. Gerhard wants to add R users in current contract for integration next year. He also thinks Python users could increase so looking at somewhere between 50 current --> 100 - 150  PWB users. Connect could increase as well. Good chance that they do User Training with Ryan and add on TPA services for R work and upcoming Azure/Kubernetes migration in 2026.

6/13/25 ES: TPA install moving smoothly for PWB + PPM but running into unique issues with PCT install. Ralf may be getting hands-on-keyboard access to Bayern's network but TBD on if that would even prove to be productive. BayernLB also only has ~4 TPA hours remaining so will likely need an extension.

As well we will have a GenAI  / LLM conversation soon.",3,Active Paid,Active Paid,Active Paid,New York,New York,United States,,"What problem(s) does each Posit product solve for the customer? 
 They use Posit Team to model, create applications, and gain insights in R and Python for the HR analytics. They look at reasons people leave, stay, hiring practices, and more. Which version of each product is the customer currently running on? Info might be out of date, but the last update I am aware of was done in December 2024 for all three products. Where does the customer run Posit's products? (on-prem/VPC/ Sagemaker/SPCS/etc.) 
 AWS - EKS 
 If PWB customer, how many different IDE's are in use? Are they integrated with Databricks or Snowflake? 
 They use RStudio IDE, VSCode, Jupyter (can't remember if it is both Lab and Notebook or only one of the two). They are interested in testing Positron soon too. 
 If PCT customer, how many content types are published on connect? 
 They use it for Shiny, APIs, and Python applications (I am not sure which ones). They also use Quarto and RMarkdown."

The group has a much better understanding of our story, product roadmap and we have commitment from them to validate our new software (PWB and PCT) and timeline to get things started early fall. We also learned more about their rollout of DBRX and Snowflake and plan to leverage Python more and more in the future.
